* Other dependencies (e.g., numpy, pandas, etc.)

## Example to Run the Codes
Provide clear instructions on how to run the code. Include examples of command-line instructions and any necessary configuration files.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    cd yourproject
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the training script with the provided configuration file:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config config.json
    ```

4. To resume training from a checkpoint:
    ```bash
    python train.py --resume path/to/checkpoint
    ```

5. To use multiple GPUs:
    ```bash
    python train.py --device 0,1 --config config.json
    ```

## Dataset
Provide information about the dataset used in the project. Include details on how to obtain the dataset and any preprocessing steps required.

For example, if using the MNIST dataset:
1. Download the MNIST dataset from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
2. Extract the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
3. Ensure the `data_loader` section in the `config.json` file points to the correct dataset path:
    ```json
    "data_loader": {
        "type": "MnistDataLoader",
        "args": {
            "data_dir": "data/",
            "batch_size": 64,
            "shuffle": true,
            "validation_split": 0.1,
            "test_split": 0.2,
            "num_workers": 2
        }
    }
    ```
